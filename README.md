## Projects based on course load(CSCI561)

# Objective
## Implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve a 3D Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
## Optimize the shortest possible path for a student (XYZ) visiting multiple locations and returning to the starting point.
## Use AI search/optimization techniques.

# Key Requirements
## Read a list of 3D coordinates representing locations in a university campus.
## Find the shortest path using Genetic Algorithm concepts.
## Ensure each location is visited exactly once before returning to the start.
## Output the total distance and the sequence of visited cities.

# Overall Approach
## Generate an initial population of random paths.
## Evaluate path distances and rank solutions.
## Select parents based on fitness.
## Perform Crossover to generate new solutions.
## Apply Mutation to introduce variations.
## Maintain Diversity to avoid stagnation.
## Iterate through Generations to refine solutions.
## Output the Best Path found.
## This ensures an efficient Genetic Algorithm-based approach to solving the 3D TSP problem optimally.
